# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
* Look for the right source of information online
* How to create, open, close, read and write files
* What are file descriptors
* What are the 3 standard file descriptors, what are their purpose and what are their POSIX names
* How to use the I/O system calls open, close, read and write
* What are and how to use the flags O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR
* What are file permissions, and how to set them when creating a file with the open system call
* What is a system call
* What is the difference between a function and a system call

## 0-read_textfile.c
### Write a function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.

__Prototype: ssize_t read_textfile(const char \*filename, size_t letters);__
* where letters is the number of letters it should read and print
* returns the actual number of letters it could read and print
* if the file can not be opened or read, return 0
* if filename is NULL return 0
* if write fails or does not write the expected amount of bytes, return 0
